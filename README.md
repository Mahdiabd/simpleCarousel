# Simple Carousel with ReactJs + BaconJs

This is a simple Carousel demo with ReactJs and very basic BaconJs to manage the stream.

Note:
I'm reusing a bit of foundation from my previous projects like eslintrc + sass-lint as a habit. The configuration is my own taste so please feel free to use different setting.
